## What does this service offer?

Musicoach aims to help coach your guitar journey with tips and reccommendations from your very own AI coach, as well as a general knowledge base of some basic guitar information. You can choose wether you want to generate a range of guitar exercises, songs, riffs or if you want to ask your coach a question.

## Who is the target audience?

The target audience is focused on anyone who desires to learn how to play or improve at the guitar. Wether they are a total beginner who dosen't know where to start out or an experienced player who is looking what song to learn next.

## Ethical and safety considerations.

The service uses the OpenAI API and set input data from the user to generate reccommended guitar exercises, songs or riffs but does not save or store any user data at all. Users are able to write freely in the chat section of the AI coach but the same policy of not saving or storing any user data applies there aswell. There is generally no cause for concern around the saftey of any user using this service that is abnormal for learning guitar elsewhere.

## Other development considerations.

Musicoach is structured to be fast and easy to use with minimal to no bloat in its interfaces. The application is built using Typescript to make sure it is as robust and future proof as possible.
